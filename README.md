This repository contains my project for the University of Zurich course DSA103 – Advanced Chemical Data Science. The goal of the project is to analyze data associated with Walker et al. (2023) and produce a reproducible Python-based workflow, a one-page data story, and accompanying documentation.

-----------------

Project Overview:

The study Walker et al. (2023), “Leaf metabolic traits reveal hidden dimensions of plant form and function” analyzes leaf metabolite profiles across tropical and temperate plant species.
My project investigates part of this dataset by analyzing chemical descriptors of annotated metabolites and exploring patterns of metabolic specialization.

The repository includes:

The project code in Python

Documentation templates (filled in according to course requirements)

A one-page data story summarizing the results

Any figures generated from the analysis
